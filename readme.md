**Project Enviroments**

The build process has been scripted directly using the CLI and NPM scripts.

#### Firstrun
`npm run create` will create directory structure required to develop into. On complete it will launch `npm start` as normal.

#### Dev

`npm start` will boot a server on port 3000 and begin listening to file changes to the usual suspects. Compiles and serves from `./public`

#### Production

`npm build` and find the output in the `./dist` folder
